## Projects I'm Proud Of
- [Main website/Dapp (web2/web3 login)](https://github.com/ensured/cardano-degen-club) - You can do lots of things like save and find recipes or mint nfts with 60+ images in 1 tx on Cardano. I will keep adding utility to this website for myself and the world.

## Learning Journey
I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies, particularly those that can enhance decentralized systems like Cardano. If you're into blockchain or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!
